# ModelPredictiveController_DMC


A "Dynamic Matrix Controller" (DMC) is a type of model predictive control (MPC) algorithm used in control systems engineering. DMC is designed to control dynamic systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs (MIMO systems) while considering constraints and optimizing control actions over a finite prediction horizon
